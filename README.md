The code is devide into several files: html, css, Js, and an API.
The html, css and Js are created and saved on umbraco backoffice.
The API is written using Visual Studio ASP.NET.
The umbraco project UI can be found on "https://kirubels-humorous-raccoon.euwest01.umbraco.io" 
To see the functionality of the code it has to run on local PC, since the API is hosted there. 
The screenshots show the project running.
